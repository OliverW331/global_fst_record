# Global Species First Record Database Project

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of the first record database of invasive species. The repositories contain various components, including data, graphs, models, and scripts that support the analysis, modeling, and simulation of invasive species records.

## Repositories Description

### 1. Data
The `data` repository houses three versions of the first record database for invasive species, available in both CSV and XLSX formats. These datasets are fundamental for all analysis and modeling tasks in the project.

### 2. Graph
The `graph` repository includes preliminary graphical analyses of the database. These graphs provide initial insights and visualizations of the data, helping to understand trends, distributions, and potential outliers in the invasive species records.

### 3. Model
Located in the `model` repository are the preliminary models fitted to the data. These models are constructed using the script `process_model_logistic_I_sig_pd_sig_pr.R` found in the `script` repository. They are crucial for predicting and understanding the dynamics of invasive species spread.

### 4. Model Graph
The `model_graph` repository contains analytical graphs generated to evaluate how well the models fit the data. These graphs are essential for visualizing the effectiveness of the models and for identifying areas where model adjustments may be necessary.

### 5. Model Result
This repository, `model_result`, includes the results of sensitivity analyses, simulations, and other outputs from model evaluations. It serves as a repository for storing detailed outcomes of various analyses that test the robustness and reliability of the models.

### 6. Script
The `script` repository encompasses all the scripts used to perform simulations, sensitivity analyses, and fitting of models to the database. This includes scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and post-analysis evaluations.
